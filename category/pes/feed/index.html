								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“How to do a major project?” is a frequently asked question by B.tech students when it’s time to submit their projects. This problem was identified and a workshop was held on 23rd September 2017 at  College of Engineering Chengannur to help students understand what is expected from them and to plan their project well to produce an outstanding​ ​one.</p>
<p>Workshops were conducted separately for four different branches of engineering viz. Civil ​( Prof. Adarsh S, Assistant Professor, TKMCE Kollam), Computer Science ​( Prof. Binu A, HOD of IT Department, Rajagiri school of Engineering &amp; Technology Kochi), Electronics &amp; Communication​(Dr. Sunil T T, Principal, College of Engineering Attingal ) and ​Electrical &amp; Electronics ​(​Dr. Dinesh​ ​Gopinath,​ ​​Associate​ ​Professor,​ ​​GEC​ ​Idukki).</p>
<p>The workshop received a great deal of appreciation from the faculty and participants equally. The faculty stated that the workshop was organised in a very impeccable manner. The participants found the workshop to be really helpful. The knowledge they acquired from this workshop would help them make exceptional projects in future. All the volunteers worked hard to put up this workshop and their efforts were noticed. All in all the workshop turned out to be a huge accomplishment for IEEE PES Student Chapter CEC and it has set the bar high.</p>
