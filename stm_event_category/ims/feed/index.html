								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A technical talk on the topic ‘Instrumentation: Scopes and Advancements’ was conducted on 21st<br />
April 2017, along with the inauguration ceremony. He introduced wide arrays of technology where<br />
instrumentation engineering has set its imprint and some which were about to be dominated.<br />
Pointing out daily phenomena, he meticulously related what each of them had in common with<br />
instrumentation and how one or the other would’ve become impossible without it. Then he went on<br />
describing various possibilities and outcomes that instrumentation engineering will bring to the<br />
world. IOT or the Internet of Things, which has become the doors to a smartly automated living for<br />
the future world, has based itself to this field of engineering. Being an insider of various<br />
technological societies, he gave an insight into the technological world’s path and destination.</p>
