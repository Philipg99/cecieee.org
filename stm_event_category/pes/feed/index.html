<p>Day 3:<br />
 Market Operations Restructured Power Systems (Smart Electricity Markets) by Dr.<br />
Kanakasabapathy (Amrita University)<br />
 Grid Integration of Non-Conventional Energy Systems by Dr. Manjula G. Nair (Amrita University)</p>
<p>Day 4:<br />
 Workshop on “Make your own Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell within 4 hours” by Amrita Green Energy<br />
Lab team, Dr. Sreekala (Amrita University) &amp;amp; Dr. K.S Sreelatha (Government College, Kottayam)</p>
<p>Day 5:<br />
 Sustainable Energy Technologies for Carbon Neutral Future Utility-Bridging Policy to Performance by<br />
 Mr. R. Suku (Chief Engineer, KSEB)<br />
 Mr. Anish H.R (Assistant Engineer, KSEB)<br />
 Energy Conservation by Dr. A.D. Ranganathan (Energy Management Center, Trivandrum)<br />
All the sessions were designed in an interactive manner which meant both the participants and the<br />
experts enjoyed being a part of these sessions. All the delegates were active and weren’t reluctant to<br />
clear doubts. The tea and lunch breaks in between provided the participants and experts an opportunity<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The IEEE PES chapter conducted this competition in association with Magnum. TESLA commenced with the<br />
prelims round, which includes 30 multiple choice questions on various topics to be completed in 20<br />
minutes. This was followed by the Logo Round where 5 logos were displayed and each team was asked<br />
to identify the logo. The final round of prelims included an Identify the Person competition, where 5 clues about a particular person (electrical engineering field related), were given and each team were asked to identify that particular person.7 teams were selected to the finals based on their score in the prelims. Each team was directed to 7<br />
different places, with clues provided at the end of every task. The final destination had the prize money<br />
attached, and the team that got there first were crowned the winners.</p>
