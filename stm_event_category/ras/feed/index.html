			<p><span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif;">ROBOTHON 4.0 was a 3-day robotics hackathon conducted by IEEE College of Engineering Chengannur Student Branch to promote the integration of science, technology, engineering in the robotic field among the students, to help build a better human society with the assistance of robots, strengthening ties between the Student branches, the Section, and Global level. The participants of the hackathon were expected to build a fully functional robot from scratch, which included designing, fabricating, programming and presenting the finished bot all within a 24-hour time limit, which was provided, as different slots in three days. The bots were judged based on their working, closeness to the theme and the concept. Students gave in their best efforts and skills during the event which turned out for Robothon 4.0 to be another successful event conducted.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) Chapter, IEEE Student Branch, College of Engineering, Chengannur conducted a six-day workshop on PIC (Peripheral Interface Controllers) for S3 students of the college from 19<sup>th</sup> to 25<sup>th</sup> July 2014. The event was aimed at providing the students with a general idea on PIC micro-controllers and its further applications in various situations. Additionally, the event served as a fundraiser for the upcoming projects for RAS CEC. The participants were divided into thirteen groups of five each. The event went as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DAY 1:</strong></p>
<p>Date: Saturday, 19<sup>th</sup> July 2014<br />
Time: 9:00 am to 3:30 pm</p>
<p>The sessions of the day were handled by Tony K James, S7, Electrical Department, Chairman, RAS, CEC SB. It started out with a basic introduction to the microcontroller and its functions. Here the students were made familiar with the electronic aspects of PIC micro-controller. It continued on to introductions of various software used for programming and simulation during working with PIC, such as Proteus, MikroC, DipTrace etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DAY 2:</strong></p>
<p>Date: Monday, 21<sup>st</sup> July 2014<br />
Time: 4:00 pm to 5:30 pm</p>
<p>The day was made use of by giving a more practical aspect to the workshop by familiarizing the students with the software used. A general circuit of chaser lights was simulated and programmed by each group of students as a starter into the main works they will be undertaking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DAY 3:</strong></p>
<p>Date: Tuesday, 22<sup>nd</sup> July 2014<br />
Time: 4:00 pm to 5:30 pm</p>
<p>The chaser circuits done in Proteus software was imported to Dip Trace software, by the student groups so as to make the PCB layout. The layouts done by the participants were re-checked by the instructors and better solutions to their problems if any were given. This session was handled by Allen George, S7, Electronics Department and Bhoumic Flint, S7, Electrical Department.</p>
<p><strong>DAY 4:</strong></p>
<p>Date: Wednesday, 23<sup>rd</sup> July 2014<br />
Time: 4:00 pm to 5:30 pm</p>
<p>The final project to be submitted by the participants included an LCD display. The circuit connections of LCD display were taught on the day. The program code for LC D&#8217;s was also passed on to the participants. The sessions were handled by Amal Suresh, S7, Electrical Department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DAY 5:</strong></p>
<p>Date: Thursday, 24<sup>th</sup> July 2014<br />
Time: 4:00 pm to 5:30 pm</p>
<p>All thirteen groups were again divided into three sections and each was given a certain project which included pattern changing chaser lights, traffic lights and indicator signals. The initial circuits for the projects were simulated by each team in the given software and PCB layouts for the circuits were also designed. The program codes were also compiled by each team and further changes to it if any were suggested by the instructors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DAY 6:</strong></p>
<p>Date: Friday 25<sup>th</sup> July 2014<br />
Time: 4:00 pm to 5:30 pm</p>
<p>The corresponding circuits of each project were made on a breadboard and were checked for possible errors and corrections. After this, the PCB layouts for the same were etched and the projects were made working by the end of the day.</p>
