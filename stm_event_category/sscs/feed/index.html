								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The SSCS Chapter, College of Engineering Chengannur organised a workshop on LATEX for efficient text processing and document generation. 3rd-year B.Tech students from Electronics and Communication Engineering and faculties from Electronics department participated in the programme. The workshop was handled by Mr Nithin Thomas Abraham from M.Tech VLSI and ES and PG students were there to assist him with a smooth functioning of the event.</p>
<p>Mrs Deepa Susan, Assistant Professor, Dept. Of Electronics Engineering delivered the welcome speech and she gave a brief introduction to LaTEX.  Then, the speaker started with basic commands of LaTEX. The participants were interested in LaTEX since they can use plain text instead of formatted text and hence he could teach how to prepare a complete report using the same. The programme ended up with 5.30 PM and the feedback shows that the participants were satisfied.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Solid state circuits society chapter members of College of Engineering Chengannur gave an awareness about IEEE and SSCS to M.Tech VLSI 1<sup>st</sup> year students on 9<sup>th</sup> September 2015. There were 23 participants present including 1st-year students and SSCS execom members.</p>
<p>The introduction was delivered by Nithin Thomas Abraham, Chairman of IEEE SSCS chapter CEC. The amazing world of Solid state devices was opened before the participants through videos showing the major milestones and IC fabrication. Anju. C, Vice-chair of SSCS chapter CEC, explained the importance of IEEE and membership benefits. Then the details of Solid state circuits society was explained by Nimya P R, Secretary of SSCS chapter CEC. She also gave awareness of the benefits of having SSCS Membership in professional as well as academic life. The activities of SSCS chapter of CEC was described in brief and the session winded up with a question about what could be next activities.</p>
<p>The awareness class had a positive feedback and most of the students were ready to take SSCS Membership.</p>

<p>The programme started at 9.30am and Dr Nisha Kuruvilla, SSCS chapter chair and Associate Professor of Dept of Electronics Engineering delivered the welcome speech. She also introduced the speaker, Dr Liza Mathew, from Mathematics Dept of Amal Jyothi College of Engineering. Dr Liza Mathew explained about different routing algorithms and graph theory in detail and she provided many design problems. She provided the detailed explanation of each design example. At the end of the two-day session, the participants were thorough and confident in design problems and algorithms. The workshop really helped the outside candidates who were doing a project in this area. After handing over the certificates the session ended up the vote of thanks delivered by Dr Nisha Kuruvilla.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>National workshop on “Advanced nano-scale device design using TCAD “ was organized by SSCS chapter College of Engineering Chengannur, India. The workshop was organized from 28<sup>th</sup> December 2015 to 1<sup>st</sup> January 2016  as a 3-day tutorial and 2-day hands own session. The event was graced with the presence of distinguished lectures from top institutions in India. The workshop attracted about 150 participants from 15 reputed academic institutions. The presence of industrial persons and other faculty members of the college also added colours to the success of the event.</p>
<p>The event began with a prayer at 9.30 am and SSCS Chapter Vice Chair Mrs Anju C  read out the Code of Ethics. Dr Jyothiraj V P, HOD, Department of Electronics Engineering, College of Engineering Chengannur welcomed the gathering. Ms Nimya P R, SSCS chapter Secretary delivered a brief overview of the event. Prof. Jyothy John, the Principal, College of Engineering Chengannur, delivered the presidential address. The function was inaugurated by Dr Yogesh S Chouhan, Associate Professor in Dept of Electrical Engg, IIT Kanpur by lighting the lamp. Dr Nisha Kuruvilla, SSCS chapter advisor and coordinator of the workshop felicitated the gathering. The inaugural ceremony concluded with the vote of thanks delivered by Mr Ayoobkhan T  E, coordinator of the workshop.</p>
<p>Dr Yogesh S Chouhan, Associate Professor in Dept of Electrical Engg, IIT Kanpur delivered an informative and interactive session on compact modelling of MOSFET, FinFET and FDSOI transistors. He explained about the modelling, simulation and characterization of nanotransistors. The second session of day one commenced at 1.30 pm after the lunch break. Dr Premlet B, Associate Professor, Dept. of Physics, TKM College of Engineering, opened the amazing world of nano-electronics to the participants. The session came to an end at 4.30 pm.</p>
<p>The second day of the conference started at 9.30 am with a talk on “MOSFET Process Variability and Variability modelling” by Dr Ajayan K R, Associate Professor, College of Engineering, Trivandrum. The session was very impressive and informative.  In the afternoon, Dr Sreelal S. Pillai, Scientist/Engineer-SG, VSSC, Trivandrum handled a session on “Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems-Design, simulation and fabrication”. The speciality of the class was that he handled each topic along with examples and videos so that participants showed great interest in the novel design techniques. It was one o the most admired session.</p>
<p>The third day started off with a technical session on “Modern CMOS Devices and Technology” by Dr.Deleep R Nair, Assistant Professor, Department of Electrical Engg, IIT Madras. He explained the VLSI concepts in a way that each and everyone could follow. He started with the basics of MOSFET, then the short channel effects and concluded with modern CMOS devices. In the afternoon session, a thorough discussion about “Compact Modelling: Theory and Practice” was conducted by Dr Jobymol Jacob, Associate Professor in Electronics, Model Engineering College Thrikkakara.</p>
<p>In the fourth day, a practical session on COGENDA TCAD  was conducted by Er. Amit Saini, Technical director, Cadre Design Systems and Mr Gaurav Musalgaonkar, Technical Consultant, Cadre Design Systems. Both device simulation and circuit simulations were explained. The attendees were happy so that they could draw the 2-dimensional structure of various semiconductor devices and visualize their characteristics.</p>
<p>The final day began with an interesting session on “Device Modelling and TCAD Simulations” handled by Dr Rama S Komaragiri, Associate professor in Dept of ECE, NIT Calicut. In the afternoon session, hands-on session on COGENDA TCAD was continued in which 3D device drawing using coding scheme was narrated.</p>
<p>The coordinators were really proud to present such an event in the starting year of SSCS chapter itself. The event was funded by the SSCS extra subsidy program.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The SSCS Chapter took part in ‘Magnum’, the technical festival of the college by organising a technical stall showcasing the various types of equipment and tools used in VLSI system design. The event had a participation of more than 150, from B.Tech, M.tech  &amp; School students, faculties from nearby schools and people from surrounding locality.</p>
<p>The amazing world of VLSI was opened before the participants through posters showing the evolution of VLSI. It was followed by a demo for virtual reality which grabbed the attention of the audience. VLSI design flow from device to the circuit and then to architecture level was shown using various tools such as Cogenda TCAD, Tanner EDA and FPGA kit. IC fabrication videos were played which was attractive and informative. The objective of the event was to provide a brief overview of VLSI to the audience and to encourage their interest.</p>
<p>The stall served as an informative session for the participants who attended the technical fest. The stall could create a positive impact on the participants.</p>
