They gave a basic idea about Arduino as it is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board and a piece of software, or IDE used to write and upload computer code to the physical board. The Arduino platform has become quite popular with people and for good reason. Unlike most previous programmable circuit boards, the Arduino does not need a separate piece of hardware in order to load new code onto the board – can simply use a USB cable. Additionally, the Arduino IDE uses a simplified version of C++, making it easier to learn to program. Thus the participants well familiarized with Arduino.</span></p>

sample circuit diagram, the class was guided through how to add the components, place<br />
them, auto-rotate, resize features etc.<br />
After the schematic diagram was done, it was time to wrap up the class for the day. Before<br />
concluding the session, Mr. Mohammed Roshan also made a briefing on printing the<br />
circuit in the well maintained Fab Lab, soldering the components and sensor detection.<br />
The session was carried out in an interactive manner hence even the amateurs grasped<br />
the concept in an effective way. The session ended at 5:00 pm.</p>

			<p>The creative session was scheduled for two alternate days starting from 8th March 2018<br />
from 4:00 pm – 5:00 pm and was led by Ganesh S, IEEE Student Branch College of<br />
Engineering Chengannur Vice Chairman, who has expertise in designing and<br />
Photoshop-related functions. He put forward a fun-filled interactive session on Graphic<br />
Design &amp;amp; Photoshop to enlighten and then instigate the participants. As planned, the<br />
workshop began at 4 pm. The program was aimed at providing better apprehension of<br />
graphic designing and to familiarize the basic Photoshop related functions.<br />
The workshop was divided broadly into two sessions: first ‘a talk by guest speaker’ and<br />
second ‘a hands-on session’. The sessions used a variety of approaches—presentations, discussions etc. The two-day workshop covered both theoretical and practical aspects of Graphic Designing. Participants took a keen interest in practical work to acquire hands-on experience. Students from various branches attended the session with great enthusiasm which hints at the very success of the workshop.</p>

			<p>A one-day FABLAB Workshop was conducted on 10th March 2018 to empower,<br />
enlighten and invoke technical knowledge in girls and to polish their technical abilities to<br />
keep up with the pace of advancing technology. On 10th March 2018, the sessions were taken by senior students of the institution Mr. Harris Joyse and Mr. James Joseph, CIT-CEC Mentors, whose enthusiasm and a keen interest in sharing knowledge inspired the audience.</p>
<p>It began with a quick introduction to the section’s aim:<br />
• To provide students the opportunity to build their own innovative products.<br />
• To familiarize students with the Hard and Soft design tools.<br />
The session introduced new design software like Landscape, AutoCAD Fusion 360, and<br />
Cura etc. The design software was provided to all the participants and guided for designing innovative products through sample designing. After designing, an introduction to the laser printer and 3D printing technology was given. Sample designs were printed and the design expiates were discussed among the students. The session was carried out in an interactive manner hence even the amateurs grasped the concept in an effective way. The session proved effective from the feedbacks and active responses received from the attended participants. The workshop wrapped up by 5:00 pm.</p>
