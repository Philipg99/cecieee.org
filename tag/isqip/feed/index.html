								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IEEE Student Quality Improvement Programme (ISQIP) is a week-long internship training program from IEEE Student Branch College of Engineering Chengannur offering both technical and managerial sessions for the overall development of the student. ISQIP helps the students to envisage an industrial approach towards their field of study by paving them a way to ponder more about the summer internship opportunities through an internship drive held by various organizations at the college, to create an internship culture just like in IITs and IISC which enable the students to do training at companies or various premier institutes in and around the state during the summer vacation and transform them into industry ready professionals.<br />
ISQIP is organized in two phases : one is CS ISQIP and the other is EC ISQIP. We offer rewarding and potentially lucrative opportunities by making their concepts exquisite through our superlative training session.</p>
